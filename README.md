# Background
- Watching E1 of Limited Netflix series "A Man in Full"
- I pause exactly half-way (22min) of the this Episode
- And investigate who the writer of this show is
- My Google search leads me to the "wrong link":
- The [novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Man_in_Full#Summary) on which it is based:
- One word catches my eye: `Stoic philosophy`; I'm immediately convinced there's a Princeton Graduate involved
- So, Tom Wolfe didn't go to Princeton, but this work is criticized by Updike!
- The creator of the Netflix series, however, did his undergrad at Princeton!!
- Regina King happens to have directed episode 1, 5, and 6
- Prediction accuracy or pure chance? Let's go by the odds

# Methods
- I’ll say this: you wanna get in the game, you’ve gotta get some dirt under those pretty fingernails, coz that’s where its at - **A man in Full** `S1E1: Saddlebags`

Academia vs. Industry: [sad to say but](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLKoDkbS1Cg) I'd choose the place with more "compute"    
When in the consensus zone you're not novel or good for a startup; that's communal, yet startup is individual
